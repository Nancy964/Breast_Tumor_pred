# Breast Cancer Prediction

## Overview
Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality among women worldwide. Early detection and accurate prediction of breast cancer can significantly improve treatment outcomes and survival rates. This project presents a machine learning-based approach to breast cancer prediction using a logistic regression model, implemented with a user-friendly interface developed in Flask.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to provide a web application that allows users to input patient data and receive real-time predictions regarding the likelihood of breast cancer. The application utilizes a logistic regression model trained on a dataset sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains various features related to breast cancer tumors.

## Key Features
- *User -Friendly Interface*: Developed using Flask, the application provides an intuitive interface for users to input patient data.
- *Real-Time Predictions*: Users can input features related to breast cancer tumors and receive immediate predictions on whether the tumor is malignant or benign.
- *Logistic Regression Model*: The model is trained to classify tumors based on various features, providing interpretable results.
- *Data Preprocessing*: The project includes data preprocessing steps to ensure the model is trained on clean and relevant data.
- *Performance Evaluation*: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Features Used for Prediction
The following features are utilized in the prediction model:
1. *Radius Mean*: The mean radius of the tumor.
2. *Texture Mean*: The mean texture of the tumor.
3. *Perimeter Mean*: The mean perimeter of the tumor.
4. *Area Mean*: The mean area of the tumor.
5. *Smoothness Mean*: The mean smoothness of the tumor.
6. *Compactness Mean*: The mean compactness of the tumor.
7. *Concavity Mean*: The mean concavity of the tumor.
8. *Concave Points Mean*: The mean number of concave points in the tumor.
9. *Symmetry Mean*: The mean symmetry of the tumor.
